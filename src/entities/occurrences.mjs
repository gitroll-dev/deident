// The drill-down index: every occurrence the substituter actually replaced,
// with the session it was in.
//
// cli-ux §5: "A count nobody can drill into is a count nobody believes." The
// export reports a spelling replaced N times and offers ONE excerpt for it, so
// the owner's real question (are those N a person's name or an ordinary word)
// has no answer on this machine. Measured 2026-08-24 on the live corpus, that
// is not hypothetical: an ordinary noun meaning "meeting" counted 202 and had
// to fail, a brokerage counted 255 and had to pass, and no threshold separates
// them. Only the occurrences do.
//
// Built by the sweep that was already running. probeCounts walks every retained
// string with the shipped matcher to produce those counts; this file is the
// sink it calls per occurrence, so §5 costs no extra pass over the corpus and
// cannot disagree with the number it is drilling into.
//
// DANGEROUS, and more so than anything else deident writes. It pairs a
// pseudonym with the real spelling it replaced and with the real session id, so
// it is the one artifact on the machine that re-identifies the archive.
// entities.json and export-map.txt each hold half of that; this holds both.
// It gets the same handling as the dictionary and F151 asserts all three
// places it must not be: never an archive entry, never the output directory,
// never the repository.
