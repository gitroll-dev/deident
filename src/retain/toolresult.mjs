//
// §4.1: for an Edit, the tool_result content block is prose with ZERO line
// information ("The file ... has been updated successfully."), while
// `toolUseResult.structuredPatch` carries {oldStart, oldLines, newStart,
// newLines, lines[]} with +/- prefixes. structuredPatch is the ONLY
// machine-readable added-line count in the record.
//
// §4.2: net line count is not a substitute. Measured over 511 edits: true
// added 9,290, removed 5,338, net 3,952, the net undercounts true added by
// 57.5%, and 123 edits (24.1%) have added>0 with net==0.
//
// §4.3: `null` and `0` are different, and `0` is the dangerous one. A wrong 0
// manufactures an "abandoned" session downstream and the existing partition
// invariant still sums correctly, so no test catches it.
//
// The patch body is code and is discarded after counting.
