// BRIEF §6 posture: four of six scoring axes depend on rules that are not in
// any local repo, so prefer preserving evidence over shrinking bytes wherever
// the two conflict, and make every truncation threshold a named constant in
// ONE file so it can be changed without a rewrite.
//
// No literal number with a policy meaning appears anywhere else.

// The tool_result head/tail caps used to live here, with a comment conceding
// that nobody knew what `failure_signal` was counted from and that the values
// were therefore "set generously, not tightly". Nothing is truncated now
// because nothing is kept, so there is no threshold left to hedge about: the
// open question is MOOT rather than answered. `is_error` is still preserved
// verbatim, which is the half of that hedge that was load-bearing.

/**
 * BRIEF §6 posture again: thinking blocks are agent reasoning, so they are

 *
 * This comment used to call them "the single largest byte lever", which is
 * false on the corpus in front of it and was never measured. Claude Code
 * writes the block with `thinking: ""` and keeps only the encrypted
 * `signature`, so the reasoning text is not in the log at all. Counted over
 * the 30 largest sessions on this machine: 7,771 thinking blocks, every one
 * of them empty, 0 bytes. `retainBlock` drops them on the empty-string guard
 * and this constant never decides anything here.
 *
 * It stays true, and the case stays, because a harness that DOES persist the
 * text is exactly what BRIEF §4.4 says not to guess about. Turning the knob
 * on the strength of one client's behaviour would discard reasoning prose for
 * every other one.

 * uncapped prose. Every one of those characters is counted and stated, in the
 * file, in the report and in --json. A silent cap is what made the old one a
 * disclosure; a stated one is a trade the reader can see.
 *
 * Most of the growth is the dedupe change, not the cap, and that half is not
 * restorable: the old key was a chunk's first 80 characters and it discarded
 * 1,590 chunks (10,443,749 characters) that were not identical to the chunk
