/**
 * The prose half of the two tables above: which fields of a RETAINED record
 * hold text a reader must be shown.
 *
 * `extractProseBySession` in pipeline.mjs used to answer this question a
 * second time, by naming two record types, two block types and a generic
 * scrape of an attachment's string values. That second list went stale the
 * moment a `queued_command`'s `prompt` stopped being a raw string and became a
 * retained block array: the scrape found no string under it, the prompt
 * vanished from deident-candidates.txt, and the archive shipped it anyway,
 * with the export exiting 0 and every check green. 506 of the 527 prompts in
 * the corpus it was measured on had exactly the shape that regressed.
 *
 * That class is the worst one this tool has: the candidates file is what a
 * human reads, and the semantic pass is the only producer that can catch a
 * name nothing else recognises. A name that is retained but never put in front
 * of the reader is un-declarable BY CONSTRUCTION. It is also the fourth time
 * two lists have answered one question here, so there is one list, and the
 * extractor reads it rather than restating it.
 *
 * Keyed by FIELD NAME rather than by record type, because a field name is what
 * survives retention: `retainTurn` and `retainAttachment` emit the SAME block
 * array under different keys, and `retainContent` is already polymorphic over
 * the array and string forms. So is this table.
 *
 *   'prose'  a reader must see it. An array is walked as retained blocks; a
 *            string is shown as it stands.
 *   'skip'   an identifier, a stamp, a role, a tool name, or the one gap
 *            docs/limits.md declares. Not descended into either.
 *
 * An UNDECLARED field falls to 'prose', because between showing the reader a
 * uuid and hiding a sentence from them, only one of the two is the bug this
 * table exists for. F204 then fails on the undeclared field, so the fail-open
 * default buys safety without buying silence.
