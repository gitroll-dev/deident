// docs/privacy-tiers.md §3: "Nobody is going to answer 31 questions. The tool
// derives a proposal from signals it can read, and the person corrects the
// rows that are wrong." A tool that proposes nothing has moved the whole cost
// of the design onto the user, and a user facing 29 questions answers none.
//
// One row of that table cannot be honoured offline and is deliberately not
// guessed: "git remote is a public repository -> open". Repository visibility
// is not on disk. A remote URL says nothing about who may read it, and BRIEF
// §2 forbids the network call that would answer it. `open` is weaker than
// `redact` (privacy-tiers §5), so guessing it wrong leaks.
//
// No proposal is exportable at all. `redact` and `open` are reached only by a
// person typing one of them, and every proposal here is `exclude` or
// `unclassified`. The reason is measured rather than cautious: `scan` writes
// the proposal into column 1 of review.md, so a proposal read back is
// indistinguishable from a decision, and two exports shipped on that with
// every gate green. See the remote branch below for the whole argument.

// fork's `upstream` owner was never an entity, and `git config --get` in

// in the material, and buildEntities dedupes on the canonical string. Taking
// only the winner would throw away the identity `git config --get` used to be
// the only source of.
//
// Behaviour on the three failure paths is unchanged, which is what lets it swap
// in under the existing callers: outside a repository it returns global user
// lines and no remote lines, which is "no remote"; a directory that does not
// exist exits non-zero, which is "no remote"; git absent from PATH is ENOENT.
