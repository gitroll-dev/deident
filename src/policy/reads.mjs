// Which shipped sessions a human actually opened, so the manifest can say so.
//
// Two archives shipped with every gate green and both leaked. Every gate in
// this tool is an internal-consistency check (cli-ux §12b), so not one of them
// can answer "was everything that should have been substituted, substituted".
// The only instrument that can is a person reading a session, and until now the
// export had no way to say whether that ever happened. An archive whose
// manifest is silent about it reads as an archive somebody checked.
//
// This file records nothing about content and nothing about entities. It is a
// list of session ids with the date each was opened, which is strictly less
// than occurrences.json already holds, and it lives beside the salt for the
// same reason: a real session id is a re-identification handle for the archive,
// and the output directory is the one the person is standing in when they send
// it.
//
// It is NOT a gate. cli-ux §12b argues the case against adding a check that
// repeats what the entity-table gates already do; the case here is narrower.
// A gate a person clears by opening one arbitrary session buys a checkbox,
// not a look, and a gate that can only ever be red on a 205-session corpus
// is the first thing switched off. The number ships WITH the archive instead,
// to the recipient, who is the person the claim is being made to. The uploader
// cannot make it look better without doing the reading, and cannot hide it.
