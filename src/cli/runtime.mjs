// `node:zlib`'s crc32 arrived in Node 20.15 and 22.2, and it is used in exactly
// one place: buildZip, which is step 17 of 17. On an older Node a person reads
// the corpus, classifies it, substitutes, passes every gate, and only then
// gets `TypeError: crc32 is not a function` - which the entry point wraps as
// "internal error, please report this". That is the shape BRIEF section 2
// forbids, arriving after ten minutes of work, for something knowable in
// microseconds.
//
// A package.json `engines` field does not do this. npm's engine-strict defaults
// to false, so it warns and proceeds, and the documented way to run this is
// `node deident.mjs`, where npm is not involved at all. The check has to be in
// the program.
