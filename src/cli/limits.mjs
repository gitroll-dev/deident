// seed.mjs was adding them to the entity list, a disclosure hiding an
// implemented-but-inert control, which is worse than either honest option."
//
// It was then fixed in report.mjs and missed in the two files that also print
// it. Measured 2026-08-22: review.html and the --preview file both still read
// `device fingerprint: MCP server names, …` for a run whose entity table
// replaced 2,864 MCP names, and neither carried the residue line or the
// embedded-occurrence count that the terminal manifest carries. Three copies
// of a security disclosure is three chances to be wrong; there is one now, and
// report.mjs, preview.mjs and reviewfile.mjs all render it.

/** What survives every control this tool has. Nothing measured goes here. */
// One line per item: every renderer prints them as a list, and a wrapped
// second line becomes a bullet of its own in review.html.
// Three entries left this list when the tool_result payload was deleted, and
// they left because they became FALSE, which is the only reason an entry may
// leave. cli-ux §6: a disclosure hiding an implemented control is worse than
// either honest option, and so is a disclosure of a route that no longer
// exists, because it teaches a reader to distrust the rows that are real.
//
//   "verbatim documents a tool read for you"   a tool result ships as a byte
//                                              count now. Nothing a tool read
//                                              reaches the archive as text.
//   "…a key a command printed for you is       a key a command printed for you
//    caught by shape or not at all"            is not in the export at all.
//
// The agent-memory line did NOT leave, and nearly did. Its wording was about a
// memory file a tool READ for you, which is the closed route; the deny-list
// underneath it still decides two live questions, whether a tool_use parameter
// may name that file and whether an attachment carrying it survives. A user
// whose memory files are named otherwise still needs to be told, and still has
// denied.json as the remedy. So the line is narrowed rather than removed.
//
// What replaced them is narrower and true: the parameters of the tool calls.
