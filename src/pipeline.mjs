/**
 * The directory a command writes into. NEVER throws a raw ENOENT.
 *
 * This was `path.resolve(flags.out ?? process.cwd())` in all three commands.
 * process.cwd() is the same shape as the os.userInfo() bug: a platform call
 * that throws where the code reads a value. On POSIX a directory can be
 * removed while a process sits in it, and the next process.cwd() raises
 * `ENOENT: no such file or directory, uv_cwd`. Windows holds a handle on the
 * working directory so it cannot be removed, which is why it never showed up
 * on the machine this was written on; `cd /tmp/x && rm -rf /tmp/x` in another
 * terminal is all it takes on a teammate's.
 *
 * main() caught it, so nobody saw a traceback. What they saw was worse:
 * wrapUnexpected turned it into "internal error ... This is a bug in deident,
 * not a problem with your data ... Report it with this line". That is the
 * answer homeDir() was written to stop giving. It is an environment, it has a
 * remedy, and the remedy is a flag.
 *
 * path.resolve is inside the try because it reads process.cwd() itself for a
 * relative argument, so `--out ./here` lands on the same corner.

 * silent in every one of them. See missingDenyWarning.
 *
 * Called BEFORE anything reads a session, and that position is the whole point
 * for known-values.json: a malformed one refuses in the first second rather
 * than at step 8 of an export that has already spent twenty minutes in the
 * retention pass.
