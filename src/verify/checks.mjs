 * rows read as though it did. This is the counterweight, and it has to carry a

 *
 *   sessions nobody read     always 0 here. checkSemanticPass refuses the
 *                            export while it is not, so by the time this
 *                            prints it can only ever say zero, and a number
 *                            that is always zero is decoration.
 *   classes with no detector  a constant, and already disclosed in the "NOT
 *                            protected against" block of the same report. Saying
 *                            it twice is the duplicate-confirmation failure
 *                            this whole change exists to remove.
 *   prose bytes              measured on THIS run, and the operator can move
 *                            it: excluding a workspace, or reading more of
 *                            what the candidates file offers, changes it.
 *
 * Prose is the only part of the corpus a reader is ever shown: the candidates
 * file is prose, and a name that appears only in a directory listing or a code
 * block never reaches a reader, cannot be declared, and cannot be scanned for.
 *
 * What this line MEASURES changed when the tool_result payload was deleted,
 * and reporting the same figure afterwards would have been a false claim in
 * the honest direction. It used to say that 78.1% of the archive went in front
 * of nobody, and that 78.1% really was unread session text: measured on the
 * archive built from the live corpus, tool_result payloads alone were 28.8% of
 * it. They are gone, and what is left of the non-prose share is mostly not
 * text at all. Same corpus, after:
 *
 *   record scaffolding, minted ids, timestamps   48.4%
 *   tool_use parameters                          16.3%
 *   tool_result shape (an id, a bool, an int)     3.6%
 *   cwd                                           2.1%
 *
 * So the honest blind spot is no longer the whole non-prose remainder. Three
 * quarters of that remainder is a vocabulary this tool defines in its own
 * source, or an identifier it minted itself, and neither can hold a name
 * nobody declared. The part that CAN is `tool_use` parameters: free text, the
 * model's own, and the one surface still in the archive that no reader is
 * shown. That is the number this reports, beside the total, rather than
 * letting a scaffolding-heavy percentage stand in for a risk.
 *
