# CLI user experience, the slice 1 contract

**This is part of slice 1, not a later polish pass.** The tool's job is to make
an engineer willing to hand over their session logs. That willingness is produced
by the interface, not by the substitution algorithm. Build to this.

The browser review UI is deferred (trigger: the first uploader who is not on the
team). Everything below is terminal plus plain files, and is sufficient for the
seven-person internal run.

---

## 1. Four commands, and the first three write nothing dangerous

```
deident scan      survey what is here and propose tiers.  Writes review.md only.
deident review    render review.md as a readable HTML file. Writes nothing else.
deident triage    offer each still-kept session's first prompt; apply verdicts.
                  Writes deident-triage.txt, and review.md with --apply.
deident export    run every check, then produce the zip.
```

Bare `deident` and `deident --help` print usage and exit 0. **Bare `deident`
never exports.** The default action of a tool that ships data off a machine is to
show you what it would do.

## 2. `scan`, the census comes before any question

Nobody can consent to something whose scale they cannot see.

```
$ deident scan

  Claude Code sessions   225 files · 818 MB · 2026-05-02 → 2026-08-22
  Workspaces             31

  Proposed tiers
    exclude         29 workspaces   208 sessions   (16 have a git remote and are
                                                    yours to admit, 3 matched the deny-list)
    unclassified     2 workspaces     8 sessions   (excluded until you decide)

  Nothing has been written except review.md.
  Next:  deident review        (look at it)
         deident export        (after you have)
```

Counts, sizes and a date range. No progress bars.

A first run has no `redact` row and no `open` row, and that is the entry gate
rather than an empty corpus: nothing deident proposes is exportable, so those
two tiers appear only once somebody has typed one (privacy-tiers §3). The
parenthesis is what stops default-deny from being 31 questions. `exclude 29
workspaces` on its own is a census that says nothing about what to do next;
the count of rows carrying a git remote is the short list worth reading.

## 3. `review.md` is both the report and the config

The decision is made by **editing a text file**, not by answering prompts.
Engineers trust a file they can grep, diff and keep. A prompt sequence cannot be
reviewed by a second person; a file can.

```markdown
# deident review · 2026-08-22
# Edit the tier in column 1, save, then run: deident export
# Tiers: exclude | count-only | redact | open

## workspaces

## sessions worth a second look
drop   2026-08-14  northwind   "幫我看一下這個月薪水怎麼算"      cwd touched \private
keep   2026-08-15  northwind   "把 passport 的 hero section 重做"
keep   2026-08-16  northwind   "這個 residual scan 要怎麼寫"

## entities to be replaced  (47)
PERSON_03   ← 3 spellings, 988 occurrences   confidence: high   (seeded from git config)
ORG_01      ← 2 spellings, 412 occurrences   confidence: high   (seeded from git remote)
PERSON_11   ← 1 spelling,   4 occurrences    confidence: LOW    (semantic pass)  ← check me
```

Rules this shape enforces:

- **Low-confidence entities are listed individually and marked.** They never share
  a collapsed row with high-confidence ones. A row reading `names 12 items
  [expand]` is a button nobody presses; that is how the review becomes theatre.
- **The per-session list exists** and is the last escape hatch, because no
  classification scheme is right the first time. Sessions whose `cwd` touched a
  deny-listed path are pre-marked `drop`.
- **`unclassified` is visible and excluded.** New workspaces are never swept in.

## 4. `review --html`, read in the browser, decide in the text file

One self-contained HTML file, written to disk, opened by the user. **No local
server.** That sidesteps the whole localhost-CSRF and port-binding threat surface
for zero loss: viewing needs no interactivity, and the decision already lives in
`review.md`.

It renders side-by-side before/after for a sample of every replacement class, and
lets the reader search. That is the visualisation that makes someone comfortable;
the writing side stays in a text file they control.

### Layout reference, with one hard constraint

https://vibeprompts.dev is a prompt library that emits Tailwind markup. Three of
its fifteen categories are relevant here and are worth reading for layout ideas:
**Dashboards** (data tables, admin panels), **Stats Bars** (metrics, progress
indicators) and **Onboarding** (setup wizards, checklists, the scan → review →
export flow is exactly a three-step checklist). The rest are marketing-page
sections and do not apply.

**Do not take the markup literally.** The page must be a single self-contained
file: no CDN `<script>`, no external stylesheet, no remote font, no image URL.
Two reasons, and the second is the one that matters:

1. The tool makes no network calls, by design.
2. A page that renders somebody's redacted session log while fetching a script
   from a third-party CDN is the wrong optic for a privacy tool, even though the
   data itself never leaves. The first person who opens devtools and sees an
   outbound request stops trusting the whole thing, and they are right to.

So: borrow the layout, write the CSS inline, keep the file standalone. Any prompt
output that arrives with `class="..."` Tailwind utilities has to be translated,
not pasted.

Accordions from that library are usable for high-confidence classes only.
Low-confidence entities are never collapsed (§3).

## 4b. `triage`: the cheap stage, and the only one that may only ever remove

Sits between `scan` and the entity list. It exists because of one measurement
(2026-08-24, live corpus): 205 sessions, and each session's workspace plus its
first user prompt truncated to 300 characters is a 23,302-character payload,
about 7k tokens. The entity pass that follows reads 915 KB, about 250k tokens.
A 35x difference for the stage that decides whether a session ships at all is
worth a command.

That 915 KB predates the candidates file carrying whole prose chunks, which was
measured over the whole depth-0 corpus at **3.95x** the old size (2,957,659
bytes to 11,684,461, with 1,336,271 characters cut by the per-chunk limit and
reported). The 35x argument only gets stronger; the number to budget against is
the larger one.

The same measurement decided the shape: **0 of those 205 sessions carry an
`ai-title` record.** Titles are not available. The first user prompt is the
surface; 161 of 205 have one, and a session that has none says so on its row
rather than being hidden.

### The prompt shown is the first one that says something

Not literally the first. The whole cost argument above rests on one prompt being
representative of a session, and a session that opens with `/clear` used to put
a command envelope in front of the reader and nothing else. One of the two
sessions that shipped 21 identity fields in plaintext (§12) opened exactly that
way, so triage had nothing to judge and it went through.

Measured 2026-08-25 over the live corpus root at depth 1, the way
`resolveCorpus` scopes it:

```
  session files                              214
  no user prompt in the head at all           28   13.1%
  first prompt is a bare slash command        17    7.9%
  CONTENTLESS FIRST PROMPT, TOTAL             45   21.0%

  a later prompt in the same head has content 15
  every prompt in the head is contentless      2
  nothing to judge even after the fix         30

  which bare command:  /clear x11  /model x2  /login  /mcp  /reload-plugins  /doctor
```

The 15 recoverable ones are answered by the very next prompt, 14 at index 1 and
1 at index 2, and it is inside the 256 KB head that was already read. **The fix
costs no extra I/O and reads no further into any file.** Triage stays the cheap
stage; that is the constraint, not a preference.

Two rules follow:

- **A row whose prompt was not the first says so**, on its own line above the
  prompt: `(not the first prompt: /clear came first)`. A reader who believes
  they are looking at how a session opened would otherwise draw conclusions
  about it from a prompt that arrived after a context reset.
- **A row with nothing to judge says which kind of nothing it is**: no user
  prompt in the session at all, or every prompt a bare command. The triage
  rubric already answers both, and its answer is `drop`.

The test is structural, not a length floor. A slash command arrives as the
literal 106 characters `<command-name>/clear</command-name>` plus an empty
`<command-message>` and an empty `<command-args>`; a command WITH arguments
carries what the person typed and counts as content. A character floor was
measured and rejected: only 2 plain-prose first prompts on that corpus are under
12 characters and 13 are under 20, while a complete and perfectly judgeable
question written in Han script runs to 18. A floor tuned on Latin prose throws
away the shortest scripts first.

The envelope is also never rendered raw. It is structure, not prose, and it
spends 106 characters of the budget this stage exists to ration. `/goal ship the
ledger` is what the reader sees.

```
$ deident triage --out <workdir>

  164 sessions still proposed keep, 300 characters of first prompt each
    3 of them have nothing to judge and say so in the file
    9 of them open with a bare command, so a later prompt is shown and the row says so

  → deident-triage.txt    23.4 KB
    Reading this will cost roughly 6,990 tokens.
      triage           5,830   (23,302 characters)
      the reader's own reasoning adds about 20%
    Raw prose: tier-0 substitution has not run over it. Local only, like review.md
    A verdict can only ever drop a session. There is no keep verdict
```

`deident-triage.txt` holds one block per session the review still proposes to
`keep`: id, date, workspace, and the truncated first prompt. Only the HEAD of
each session file is read (256 KB), never the whole thing. A triage that reads
the whole session is the expensive stage wearing a hat. `--triage-chars <n>`
moves the limit, bounded at 2,000, because a limit high enough to carry whole
sessions undoes the command quietly with every check still green.

The reader writes `deident-triage.json` beside it:

```json
{"verdicts": [{"id": "<session id>", "verdict": "drop", "reason": "one line"}]}
```

### The constraint, which is the whole design

**A triage verdict may only ever move a session toward `drop`.** It may never
propose `keep` and it may never overturn an existing `drop`. Both halves are
enforced in code: `keep` is a refusal naming the row, and a verdict against a
row that already reads `drop` is a counted no-op.

That is what makes a cheap model acceptable at this stage and nowhere else.
`docs/model-tier.md` disqualifies the low tier for the entity pass because its
failures are MISSES, and a miss there is a disclosure. Here the only power on
offer is removal, so a wrong verdict costs coverage and never privacy. The
moment a verdict can release a session, that argument is gone, which is why the
rule lives in the parser rather than in the header.

`unsure` is the second accepted value and changes nothing. It exists so a row
somebody looked at and left alone does not read the same as a row nobody
reached.

```
$ deident triage --apply --verdicts deident-triage.json --out <workdir>

  ! verdict for "a3f9..." was not applied: no session with that id, and none in
    the corpus either. It was probably deleted between runs

  12 verdicts read
    9 applied
    2 changed nothing (already dropped, or "unsure")
    1 matched no row in review.md (see the warnings above)

  → review.md
```

`--apply` writes `drop` into column 1 of the `## sessions` section and appends
the reason to that row, then remembers the drop in
`~/.deident-private/workspaces.json` beside the tiers, so a later `scan` into a
different directory does not lose it (§11).

A verdict naming a session that is not in the corpus is a **warning, not a
refusal.** Sessions get deleted between runs, and refusing would throw away
every other verdict in the same file over somebody tidying a directory.

Two properties of the file that a reader has to be told, and the file tells
them itself:

- It carries **raw prose**. Unlike `deident-candidates.txt`, tier-0 substitution
  has not run over it, so handing it to a model sends untouched session text to
  that model. That is the cost, and it is why the payload is one truncated line
  per session rather than a transcript. Local only, like `review.md`.
- It offers only sessions currently proposed `keep`. Paying a reader to look at
  a session that is already out is the waste the command exists to remove.

## 5. Every number is traceable back to evidence

A count nobody can drill into is a count nobody believes.

Both queries read an index the export writes. The export already sweeps every
retained string with the shipped matcher to produce `replacementCounts`; that
sweep records each occurrence as it goes, so the drill-down costs no extra pass
over the corpus and cannot disagree with the number that sent the reader to it.

```
$ deident review --entity PERSON_11

  PERSON_11   person   "Grace Hopper"
  4 occurrences, 3 sessions:

    2026-08-14  northwind            55555555-5555-4555-8555-555555555511
        turn    47   ...跟 Grace Hopper 約了 call...
        turn    51   ...Grace Hopper 說他下週...

  Read one of these sessions in full:   deident review --session <id above>
```

```
$ deident review --session 55555555-5555-4555-8555-555555555511
  full redacted transcript of one session, to stdout
```

Three properties, each load-bearing:

- **The excerpts are the text BEFORE substitution.** That is the only form that
  answers the question the reader actually has, which is whether a spelling
  replaced 991 times is a person's name or an ordinary word. It also makes this
  the one command whose whole job is re-identification, so every answer ends
  with a paragraph saying the output is local and must not be sent.
- **The transcript is read back out of the archive**, not re-rendered from the
  corpus. Measured three times on the delivery run: a reviewer
  was handed something that was not what shipped, and each time the gap was
  where the leak lived.
- **Neither query reads the corpus, and neither can answer before an export.**
  These counts are what the substituter DID; a read-only pass over the corpus
  would produce a different number under the same name. With no index on the
  machine both refuse and name `deident export`, because "0 occurrences" here
  reads as "this entity is clean".

The index lives at `~/.deident-private/occurrences.json`, beside the salt and
the dictionary. It pairs pseudonyms with real spellings AND with real session
ids, which is strictly more than either `entities.json` or `export-map.txt`
holds on its own, so it gets the same handling as both: never an archive entry,
never the output directory, never the repository.

## 6. `export`, the gate is a manifest of what leaves, not a spinner

```
$ deident export

  Checks
    5 passed. Jointly they assert one thing about the entity table:
    every spelling in it was substituted wherever the scan found it, and the
    result reverses. Not one of them asks whether the table is complete, or
    whether it names everyone in these sessions.
    the table came from   --entities deident-entities.json · 12 entities · 170/170 sessions read

    unverified   323.2 KB of these sessions is prose, and prose is the only
                 part a reader is ever shown. The archive is 14.2 MB, and
                 97.8% of that is not prose. Most of it cannot hold a name:
                 record scaffolding, and identifiers deident minted itself.
                 2.3 MB of it (16.3%) is the parameters of your tool
                 calls: free text, shown to no reader, checked by nothing.

  Leaving this machine
    170 sessions from 17 workspaces
    every session here is from one of 17 workspaces you admitted by name;
      14 others were never admitted and contributed nothing

    2,104 user messages

    0 images              73 replaced with placeholders

    0 secrets             8 replaced (3 distinct)
    0 phone numbers       41 replaced (10 distinct)

    11,523 lines dropped: outside an included directory
    2 sessions retained nothing and are not in the archive

  Counted but not shared   (count-only tier)
    14 sessions from 2 workspaces: session count, work mode and outcome only

    14 occurrences of your own username or git identity are joined to
      letters or digits (yourname-prod) and were left alone by the same rule

  → <workdir>/send/deident-export-2026-08-22.zip    14.2 MB
    Send this file. <workdir>/send holds nothing else, and nothing else here may be sent
    <workdir>/WHAT-TO-SEND.txt    what each file is, and whether it may leave
    salt stays at ~/.deident-private/salt, do not share it, do not commit it
```

The distinction is printed in the block that names the archive, because a layout
the operator has to infer is the same failure as no layout at all. `--out` used
to hold the archive and five files that must never be sent (`review.md`,
`deident-candidates.txt`, `deident-triage.txt`, `export-map.txt` and the
`--preview` diff) with nothing saying which was which. The author moved
`export-map.txt` out by hand after being asked whether the directory was safe to
send, and a reviewer opened one of the raw files, saw his own details intact and
concluded the tool does nothing.

So the archive is alone in `<out>/send/` and nothing else goes in. What may be
sent is an **allowlist**, not a subtraction rule: an artifact written into `--out`
lands outside `send/` and is un-sendable by default. `<out>/WHAT-TO-SEND.txt` is
written from a listing of the directory rather than from the names the run
intended, so every file it mentions is a file that is there.

### 6a. The declared list, printed back with what it did

`~/.deident-private/known-values.json` is the third source of entities, and the
only one that is not inference. Tier 0 infers from machine state, tier 1 infers
from prose; neither can be told "this exact string is mine". §12 has the file
and the reason it exists.

Every export that had a list prints the whole list back, with the number of
occurrences each value actually claimed:

```
  4 values you declared in known-values.json, and what each replaced.
  A high count on a value of yours is not an error: it is a word that is also
  yours, and only you can tell those apart.
          31  person    Aurelio Ferreira-Nkemdirim   (deident found this one too)
          12  secret    Flat 6B, 219 Marlowe Crescent, Ashford Bay
           4  account   pm-8842-31770
           -  secret    Qi

  ! 2 of them replaced nothing, so they protect nothing:
      secret    Qi
        never substituted: shorter than 3 characters: too collision-prone to substitute safely
        so the count above is a dash and not a zero. Whether it is in the
        archive anyway is counted below, under the declared-values sweep
      secret    1974-04-31
        no occurrence of this string is anywhere in the exported text
```

The whole list and not the outliers, which is the opposite of `renderProbe`
three lines above it and is deliberate. The probe reports both tails of a list
the tool assembled, where the middle is unremarkable by construction. This list
was written by hand, by the person, about themselves, and every row in it is a
claim they made. Two of the rows are the ones nothing else prints:

- **count 0**, which means the string is nowhere in the corpus. Usually a typo
  in the list; occasionally a value that genuinely never came up.
- **`never substituted`**, which means the existing safety rules refuse to
  substitute it at any count: shorter than three characters, a single CJK
  character, a bare filesystem root. Before this it was visible only in
  `export-map.txt`, which is read after the archive already exists.

  Its count column is a dash and not a number, and that is the honest state
  rather than a formatting choice. `buildTable` puts an entity with no
  pseudonym in `flagged` and never in `entries`; `residualScan` sweeps
  `entries`. So a rejected value is never substituted, and a `0` in a
  replacement-count column would be a zero where no substitution ran.

  It is now scanned for. §12b's seventh check re-derives its needles from
  `known-values.json` on disk and sweeps the produced bytes for exactly the
  values the table never carried, so the row points at that sweep for the
  occurrence count instead of saying nobody looked.

**A high count is reported and never refused.** `src/entities/probe.mjs`
measured why no threshold works: on one corpus an ordinary noun counted 202, a
real brokerage 255 and a personal name 17, in that order. A threshold that
caught the first would refuse the third. And this is the one list where a false
alarm does structural damage, because a source that argues with a person's
deliberate declaration about their own data is a source that stops being filled
in.

### 6b. Two findings that print beside the gate and are not gates

Both exist because a check that only reports what it was given cannot report
what it was not, and both were found by grepping a zip that had passed all six
checks.

**Parts of a declared spelling that still stand alone.** `Grace Hopper`
replaced and a bare `Morgan` left behind is a half replacement: the pseudonym
appears once and the prose names him two sentences later. The same shape
reaches every other kind through multi-word spellings. An office address
declared as one comma-separated string shipped its street on its own, because
only the whole string was ever a needle.

A single word is proposed only from a `person`, because a word taken out of a
person's name is still a name. From every other kind only a contiguous run of
two or more words is proposed, because a word taken out of anything else is a
noun. That is what admits a street such as `Bramble Road` (fabricated; the
real one was a line of a registered office address) while never proposing
`Road`, `Centre` or `Advisory`. Measured 2026-08-24 on the live entity list: proposing
single words from every kind produced 16 rows led by `and` at 337 occurrences,
followed by `Pro`, `Commercial`, `USD`, `Road`, `Industry` and `South`. Runs
added none of that, and found five real half-replacements the person rule
could not see.

A word starting with a lowercase Latin letter never joins a run. `Founders and
Ivy` proposed `and Ivy` at 7 occurrences, every one of them the declared name
`Ivy`: the longer run outranks the declared spelling in the probe table and
claims spans that are already covered.

**Seed spellings that are glued to alphanumerics.** The word-boundary rule is
correct and does not change (§4.5 row 4 makes `ray` inside `array` a required
non-match), but it means a seed joined to letters or digits can never match.
Measured 2026-08-24: the OS username survived in a shipped archive 14 times
inside cloud resource names, and the export printed `known-entity residue 0`.

```
  ! 14 occurrences of your own username or git identity are still in the
    output, joined to letters or digits (yourname-prod, kv-yourname01234).
    The substituter did not replace them and that is deliberate: the word
    boundary rule cannot tell them from your name inside an ordinary word.
        14  yourname                 PERSON_01
            …storageAccounts styourname3756557093578778…

    Decide per row. A resource name you can rename before exporting is one
    fix; declaring the glued spelling itself in the entity list is another.
```

Scoped so it does not cry wolf, and the scope is the whole design. Tier-0
`person` spellings only (the OS username, the git identity and the handles
derived from it), because those are the spellings a reader can act on. A
workspace path is already substituted as a path and matches its own longer
form; an org name glued to a digit is a repo or a bucket the org already puts
its name on; a tier-1 name belongs to a third party the reader cannot rename.
Measured over the same archive, four seeds together produced 25
boundary-refused occurrences and the scope reports 14 of them.

Five characters and up is a row whatever is beside it, measured rather than
guessed. Over 18.8 MB of exported bytes, ten plausible seeds at each length:
three characters gave a median of 643 boundary-refused occurrences and a worst
case of 1,996; four gave 13 and 270; five gave 0 and 14, and the 14 were the
leak. §7 and §F7 both say what happens to a check that fires constantly.

Below five, the row is earned on the NEIGHBOUR instead, because that average
was over two populations. Re-measured over ~20 MB of session logs, splitting
the refused occurrences by whether the character that blocks is a letter:
three characters gave a letter-blocked median of 412 and a worst case of 8,371
against a separator/digit median of 20 and worst of 52; four gave 46 and 113
against 4 and 26. The flood is the letter class entirely, and the small class
is where the leaks are (`project_<name>_notes.md`, `kv-<name>0123`,
`HKID_<Name>Yan.jpg`). A length gate here denied the disclosure to every user
with a three- or four-character given name, which is the common case for
Chinese, Korean and Japanese romanisations.

What the neighbour test still withholds is disclosed rather than dropped. The
spellings and their counts go in the manifest as `gluedNotListed` and one line
of the "NOT protected against" block names them, because
`renderGluedResidue` prints nothing when there are no rows and an absent list
beside a green residue figure reads as a clean result. Do not delete that line
as redundant with this paragraph: a limit stated in a doc is not a disclosure
at the moment of export.

Both print to stderr as findings, carry `uncoveredNameParts` and
`gluedResidue` in `--json`, and neither can fail an export. A gate on the
second would refuse every export forever over behaviour §4.5 demands. The
manifest carries the second as a count, `gluedOccurrences`, and prints it in
the "NOT protected against" block.

Three blocks do the work:

- **"Leaving this machine"** is the trust mechanism. Zeros where zeros are the
  point, with the suppressed count beside each so the reader sees the material
  existed and was handled. A count that is not a zero-where-zero-is-the-point
  gets its own line shape: `0 dropped by cwd   3 lines outside an included
  directory` asserts a number and then contradicts it, in the one block whose
  whole job is being believed.
- **"Counted but not shared"** makes the `count-only` tier legible rather than
  looking like data went missing.
- **"NOT protected against"** is the honesty mechanism. A tool that only lists its
  strengths gets over-trusted, and the first surprise destroys it permanently.
  It must also not list something the tool *does* handle. MCP server names sat
  in this block while `seed.mjs` was adding them to the entity list and the
  boundary rule was guaranteeing none of them ever matched, a disclosure
  hiding an implemented-but-inert control, which is worse than either honest
  option.

### 6c. A zero row that means something

`renderProbe` prints both tails of the replacement counts. The top tail is the
noun-shaped hazard. The bottom tail is a spelling that matched nothing, and
until 2026-08-25 that block was mostly noise: `expandVariants` turns one
declared path into seven spellings, six of which are escaping twins nobody
typed and nobody expected to occur, and every one of them earned a row saying
it protected nothing. The first export shipped with declared strings that
matched zero times, and the zero row stopped nothing, because the one row that
mattered was sitting inside a wall of rows that did not.

Two changes, and neither is a gate.

**A zero on a spelling deident GENERATED is not reported at all.** `buildTable`
marks each entry `declared`: true for a spelling a person supplied or a seeder
inferred, false for one `expandVariants` derived from it. A derived twin that
did not occur is the variant generator working.

**A zero on a spelling a person supplied is split by whether the entity
matched anything else**, because those are different animals:

```
  ! 1 spelling you declared matched nothing, but the same entity matched
    through a spelling deident generated. This corpus writes it the other way:
      org       <Traditional company name>   matched as   <Simplified twin>
    Harmless for a path written with the other separator. Not harmless for a
    name or a company: anything else you declare in that form will be missed.

  ! 1 declared spelling matched nothing, so it protected nothing:
      secret    K7719284
    No other spelling of the same entity matched either.
    Usually a typo in your list, or a value you have never typed here. If the
    same identity is also declared as a separate entity, that one may already
    be covering it.
```

The first block is the Export 1 shape exactly: the declared strings were
Traditional and the corpus wrote them in Simplified. The second is what an
unused passport number legitimately looks like, and refusing on it would be a
permanently red gate.

The second block claims only what the sweep knows, and the difference is not
pedantry. Two entities can cover the same text, and then one of them matches
nothing while the identity is replaced perfectly well under the other's
pseudonym. `Northwind` and `northwind` declared as two entities do it, which is
reachable long before any Han fold, because matching is case-insensitive and
only one entry can win an offset. The sweep breaks at the first matching entry
by design, so it never learns that a loser would also have matched. So the block
says that no other spelling of the same entity matched either, and names the
shadowing possibility, rather than asserting the string is nowhere in the
corpus, which it cannot know.

**Neither block is a gate, and the first is the one that invites being made
one.** It must not be, because the same shape covers a path typed with the
other separator: there the entity was replaced everywhere it occurs and nothing
is wrong. No test orders those two, so a refusal would turn correct behaviour
into a red gate, which is §F7 arriving on schedule. The row names the spelling
that matched instead, and a reader separates them in a second.

A zero on a value from `known-values.json` needs no separate rule here. §6a
already prints that list back entity by entity with its own "replaced nothing"
block, and `declaredValueRows` sums across every spelling, so a declared value
whose twin matched shows its true total there and its typed form shows up in
the first block above.

### 6d. Simplified and Traditional Han are one entity

The reason 6c's first block exists. A person's declared redaction strings were
Traditional; the corpus contained the Simplified twins of the same words. The
substituter did not match them and the residue scan did not find them **in
agreement**, because both read `table.entries` and the entries carried one
script. Two checks that consult the same table are one check.

Measured over the real corpus root, 2026-08-25, 4,132 session files and 1.97
billion characters: 5,751,541 occurrences of Traditional-only characters beside
38,621 of Simplified-only ones. Counting every Han 2-, 3- and 4-gram that the
fold maps to a different string and that also occurs in that other form:
**33,032 strings are present in this corpus in both scripts, and 204,902
occurrences are reachable only through the fold.** Restricted by shape to
strings that could be an identity (beginning with a family name or ending in
the fixed tail of a company name or an administrative division): 488 strings
and 4,006 occurrences. The sharpest single row is a three-character personal
name occurring 240 times in Traditional and 34 times in Simplified in the same
corpus, which is the leak, still there, in the corpus that produced it.

`src/entities/hanfold.mjs` holds the table. There is no npm and therefore no
OpenCC, and a full mapping is several thousand characters. **The subset rule:**
a pair earns its place when the Traditional character belongs to the vocabulary
a Han identity string is built from: family names, the given-name stock in
common use, the fixed words of a registered company name, and administrative or
postal vocabulary. In practice that is the characters carrying one of the
productive systematic simplifications (言→讠, 金→钅, 糸→纟, 馬→马, 門→门,
車→车, 貝→贝, 見→见, 頁→页, 食→饣, 魚→鱼, 鳥→鸟, 風→风, 韋→韦, 專→专,
東→东, 長→长, 辵, 囗, 广/厂) plus the individually simplified characters that
appear in names, company names and addresses. 821 pairs. Outside it,
deliberately: general prose vocabulary and rare characters.

**The mapping is not a bijection, and getting that wrong would make this a text
corrupter rather than a redaction tool.** Several Traditional characters
collapse onto one Simplified character (發/髮 → 发, 乾/幹 → 干, 鐘/鍾 → 钟) and
several Simplified forms are themselves distinct Traditional characters
(後 → 后 while 后 means empress; 隻 → 只, 麵 → 面, 餘 → 余, 臺 → 台). So the two
directions are not the same operation:

- **Traditional → Simplified is a function** and runs on every spelling. A
  character the table does not know is left alone.
- **Simplified → Traditional is a guess** wherever the Simplified form is
  ambiguous, and a guess mints a needle for a word the person never wrote. Only
  the 751 pairs that are bijective fold back, and the reverse is **all or
  nothing per spelling**: if any character of the spelling is one this table
  knows to be ambiguous, no Traditional form is generated at all. `头发` would
  otherwise come back as `頭发`, a spelling nobody writes. That set is derived
  from the table rather than hand-listed, so it cannot drift from it.

The cost, stated rather than hidden: a Traditional spelling containing 後, 發 or
臺 still folds forward, but a Simplified spelling containing 后, 发 or 台 folds
nowhere, so its Traditional occurrences are missed. That is a miss, not a
corruption, and it is the direction `caseInsensitive()` already takes for
Turkish dotted I.

**Where the fold lives: extra spellings, not a matcher fold.** The NFC/NFD
argument in `expandVariants` does not apply, because Han pairs are one UTF-16 unit
each, so a matcher fold would keep every span length correct. Two other reasons
decide it:

- These logs nest JSON inside JSON, so a Han character arrives as the six ASCII
  characters of a `\uXXXX` escape, and `residualScan` searches
  `jsonEscaped(spelling)` for exactly that. A character-level fold cannot see
  hex digits. As a spelling, the twin picks up its own escaped form for free.
- `residualScan` and `probeCounts` both sweep `table.entries`. One addition
  reaches the substituter, the residue gate and the probe together. A fold
  inside the matcher would need the first-character index widened in
  `buildTable`, `residualScan` and `probeCounts` separately, each of which
  already carries one such special case for case-folding, and the leak this
  fixes happened because the substituter and the scan were wrong together.

The probe still counts **per spelling**, so a Traditional declared value and
its Simplified twin get one row each with their own counts, and the reader sees
which script the corpus actually uses. `declaredValueRows` sums per entity, so
§6a's total is the sum of both scripts, which is what "what this value
replaced" has always meant.

### 6e. The two lines no internal check could produce

Every gate in this tool is an internal-consistency check (§12b), so not one of
them can answer "was everything that should have been substituted, substituted".
These two lines are in the manifest because they answer something adjacent that
the gates cannot reach at all, and both ship inside the trust block rather than
in the terminal alone.

```
    every session here is from one of 17 workspaces you admitted by name;
      14 others were never admitted and contributed nothing
    9 of 170 sessions were opened and read here, 161 are unverified
```

**The first is a bound, not a check.** Nothing deident proposes is exportable
(privacy-tiers §3), so a shipped session is always from a workspace somebody
typed a tier for. That does not say the substitution found everything; it says
where a miss can live. Both archives that leaked did so from a session no
allowlist would have admitted, and this is the sentence that would have said so
in advance.

**The second is a count of reading, and it is deliberately not a gate.** Nobody
in this field claims recall of 1.0. What the recipient has no way to know is
whether a human opened any of what they are holding, and until now the manifest
was silent about it, which reads as "somebody checked".

- It counts `deident review --session`, the only path that puts a whole session
  in front of a person.
- A read stops counting once that session file changes. A transcript read in
  March says nothing about four turns appended in August, and BRIEF §4.3 is this
  repository's own record of what a number that is quietly wrong does
  downstream. Those show as a separate line, never inside the count.
- `deident review --entity` is reported separately and never folded in. It shows
  an 80-character excerpt per occurrence, so it is evidence about an entity, not
  a look at the session around it.
- `deident export --preview` counts for nothing. It carries one 45-character
  window per replacement class by construction, so it opens no session at all,
  and the preview says so where the count would otherwise be.
- At zero it says so in words. An absent line reads as "not applicable"; a zero
  reads as what it is.

Not a gate, for two reasons that point the same way. A gate cleared by opening
one arbitrary session buys a checkbox rather than a look. And a gate that can
only ever be red on a 205-session corpus is BRIEF §F7's "a scan that cries wolf
is the first thing switched off". The number ships to the recipient instead,
who is the person the claim is being made to, and it cannot be made to look
better without doing the reading.

The reads are recorded at `~/.deident-private/reads.json`, beside the salt and
never in the output directory, for the reason `occurrences.json` is: it holds
real session ids. A missing or unreadable file counts as zero reads and never
refuses, which understates rather than the other way round.

## 7. Wording is a security control

- The residue line reads **`known-entity residue    0`**. Never "safe", never
  "0 leaks", never a bare green check. The scan can only find entities it already
  knows about; the label must not claim more than the mechanism delivers.
- No emoji or colour carries meaning on its own. `ok` / `FAILED` in words, because
  colour does not survive a pasted screenshot or a colour-blind reader.
- **A passing run states the joint claim once; a failing run prints every row.**
  The six checks are one claim about one thing: round trip, substitution
  invariant, namespace, residue, semantic pass and the on-disk rescan all ask
  whether the output is consistent with the entity table they were given, and
  every one of them was CORRECT on both runs that shipped a leak. Six rows
  reading `ok` are read by a person as six independent confirmations of
  something much bigger than the claim they share. That is a presentation
  defect, so the fix is presentational and the mechanism does not change: the
  five in-memory checks collapse to one sentence that names what they assert
  and what they do not.

  It does not collapse on failure. A refusal is followed by a remedy, acting on
  it starts with knowing which check went red, and a green line that becomes an
  opaque red line is worse than the six rows it replaced. Any `ok: false` and
  the old table prints in full.

  `--json` keeps every row in both directions. Six rows read as six
  confirmations to a human; a consumer iterates the array, asserts every `ok`
  and forms no impression, and SKILL.md step 6 tells an agent to name two of
  them to the person by name. Collapsing the array would break every consumer
  and remove the per-check attribution from the one reader that can use it.
- **The remainder is stated in the same block, with two numbers.** The unit is
  prose as a fraction of the archive: prose is the only part of a session a
  reader is ever shown, so a name occurring only in a directory listing or a
  code block never reaches a reader, cannot be declared, and cannot be scanned
  for.

  The second number exists because the first one stopped being a blind spot
  when the tool_result payload was cut. Most of the non-prose remainder is
  record scaffolding, minted identifiers and tool result shape: a vocabulary the
  tool defines in its own source, which cannot hold an undeclared name.
  Reporting only the total would overstate the risk as badly as omitting it
  would understate it, so the parameters figure is printed beside it: that is
  the part that is free text and unread. Both numbers are measured on the run
  that prints them; docs/limits.md carries the archive-wide breakdown.

  Three units were rejected for it. **Sessions nobody read** is always zero
  here, because the semantic-pass gate refuses the export while it is not, and
  a number that can only ever be zero is decoration. **Entity classes with no
  detector** is a constant and is already in the "NOT protected against" block
  six lines below, so stating it here is the duplicate-confirmation failure
  this whole block exists to remove. **Prose bytes** is measured on this run and
  the operator can move it.

  It carries `unverified` in `--json`, and it is not a check and cannot fail.

## 8. Refusals name the reason and the remedy

Not a stack trace, not a bare exit code.

```
  ✗ Refusing to export: the semantic pass has not run

    Entity discovery from prose is required. The residual scan can only find
    entities it already knows about, so without this pass a "0 residue" result
    would be meaningless.

    The tier-0-cleaned prose to review is at:  deident-candidates.txt

    Produce the prose to read:   node deident.js export --preview
    Then supply the list:        node deident.js export --entities deident-entities.json
```

```
  ✗ Refusing to export: 2 workspaces are unclassified.

      passport-map      6 sessions
      demo-runner       2 sessions

    New workspaces are excluded by default and never exported silently.
    Set a tier for each in review.md, or run with --skip-unclassified to
    confirm you want them left out.
```

The refusal every first run now ends on, because nothing deident proposes is
exportable (privacy-tiers §3). It is the one screen that has to carry the next
action, so it names the file, the column, the word, and the rows worth typing it
on. Only the rows carrying a git remote are listed: a directory with no remote
has no signal arguing for it, and listing all 31 would turn the short screen
into the 29 questions nobody answers.

```
  ✗ Refusing to export: no workspace has been admitted, so the export would be empty

    A proposed tier is not an admission. deident exports a workspace only after
    you have named it yourself, so whatever it still misses can only be missed
    inside a workspace you chose.

    3 workspaces have a git remote:
      ledger                     41 sessions   C:\Users\<you>\projects\ledger
      northwind-site             12 sessions   C:\Users\<you>\projects\northwind-site
      deident                     4 sessions   C:\Users\<you>\projects\deident

    Admit one: in review.md, change "exclude" to "redact" in column 1
                                  node deident.js export
    Or see the rows again:        node deident.js scan
```

## 9. Errors name the file, the line, and the fix

Every failure the user can hit is caught and reported in this shape. A traceback
reaching the terminal is a bug, tracked as such.

```
  ✗ Could not read session file
      C:\Users\<you>\.claude\projects\C--Users-<you>\a3f9....jsonl
      line 4,102 is not valid JSON (unexpected end of input)

    This usually means the session was still being written. Close that Claude
    Code session, or skip the file with --skip-unreadable.
```

## 10. Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| 0 | success, or an informational command |
| 1 | a check failed, or the export was refused. Nothing was written. |
| 2 | bad usage. Usage text printed. |
| 3 | an input could not be read and `--skip-unreadable` was not given |

**Any non-zero exit leaves no output file behind.** Verification happens before
anything is written, never after.

Two deliberate exceptions, stated rather than hidden.

The first: the semantic-pass refusal writes `deident-candidates.txt` and then
points at it, because the whole remedy is "read this file and write an entity
list". It is written on that refusal path
and on no other, it holds tier-0-cleaned prose that the semantic pass has not
seen yet, third-party names included, by design, and the tier-0 residual scan
runs over it before it is written. Treat it the way you treat `review.md`: local
only, never shared, never committed.

The second: a SUCCESSFUL export writes `export-map.txt` into `--out`, outside
`send/` and so never beside the zip, one
`<real session id>  <archive entry>` line per exported session. privacy-tiers §4
level 3 is the last look, and a last look cannot act without attribution: every
id inside the archive has already been rewritten, so nothing on the machine
otherwise says which entry is which session. It maps a local id to a local id
rather than a pseudonym to a name, so it is not a re-identification key for the
data that left, but it is local only, never shared, never committed, and it is
removed along with the zip if anything after it fails.

## 11. Idempotence and the second run

Running `export` twice with the same input and the same salt produces
byte-identical output. Nothing prompts twice: tier decisions live in
`~/.deident-private/workspaces.json` and are reused, so the second export is one
command with no review step unless a new workspace appeared.

If a new workspace did appear, `export` refuses (see §8) rather than guessing.

### 11b. `~/.deident-private/entities.json`, the remembered dictionary

Stage 3 is the only stage whose cost grows with the corpus: 205 sessions and
about 3.5 MB of prose to budget for (§4b). A second run days later has a
handful of new sessions in it and must not cost the same as the first.

```json
{
  "_note": "deident remembers the identities you have already declared, and which sessions you have already read …",
  "version": 1,
  "updated": "2026-08-24T09:14:02.117Z",
  "entities": [
    { "kind": "person", "spellings": ["Grace Hopper", "Grace"], "confidence": "high" }
  ],
  "sessions": {
    "a3f9…": { "hash": "6b1c…", "read": "2026-08-24T09:14:02.117Z" }
  }
}
```

Plaintext, deliberately, and beside the salt. It is local-only on the owner's
own machine, and plaintext is what lets them open it and add an entry by hand.
**Hand-editing is a first-class use.** So the shape is stable, the file states
its own rules in `_note`, and a refusal names the line for a syntax error and
the entry index for a schema one.

`entities` is the same shape as `deident-entities.json`, so a row can be
copied either way. It holds the spellings **as typed**, never the escaping
variants deident expands them into: a hand-editor shown a backslash-doubled
twin of a string they never wrote cannot act on it.

`sessions` records what has been put in front of a reader. The hash is taken
over the session's **retained prose before tier-0 substitution**, because the
cleaned text carries pseudonyms and `--namespace` takes a fresh value every
run, so a hash of the cleaned text would report every session as changed every
time while looking like it worked.

Rules:

- **Merged by identity, never by position.** Two entries that share any
  spelling are one identity and their spellings union, transitively and
  case-insensitively. Two that share nothing stay separate. Merging any other
  way mints two pseudonyms for one person.
- **`--entities` is optional once this file exists.** Absent, the dictionary
  supplies the list. Present, the file wins on the identities it names and the
  dictionary supplies the rest. Dropping an identity on purpose is a hand edit
  of this file, not an omission from the flag's file: a reader answering a
  repeat run writes about the handful of sessions they were shown, and applying
  only that would drop every identity the earlier runs established with every
  gate green.
- **Missing is a first run. Unreadable or malformed refuses.** Continuing with
  no dictionary means an empty entity list and every session reported as never
  read, which looks like a corpus problem rather than a broken file.
- **It is memory, never output.** Not an archive entry, not in the output
  directory, not in the repository. It pairs real spellings with real session
  ids, so treat it the way you treat `review.md` and `export-map.txt`.

### 11c. The semantic-pass gate is per session

The gate used to be all-or-nothing: supplying `--entities` satisfied it for the
whole corpus, however much of that corpus anybody had read. A remembered
dictionary makes that insufficient, because a repeat run could satisfy it
having read nothing new.

**Every session in an export must have been through a semantic pass, in this
run or in a recorded earlier one.** A session that is new, or whose retained
prose changed since it was read, has not been, and the export refuses naming
it:

```
  ✗ Refusing to export: 3 sessions have not been through a semantic pass

      a3f9…   new since the last read
      7c02…   new since the last read
      1de4…   changed since it was last read   (written 2 minutes ago)

    A session is covered once its prose has been put in front of a reader and
    the answer is remembered. Exporting one that never was would mean claiming
    a semantic pass covered text nobody has seen.

    The other 202 sessions are covered and were left out of the file below.
    The tier-0-cleaned prose to read is at:  deident-candidates.txt
```

This is **stricter** than the old gate, including in a direction that has
nothing to do with the dictionary: `export --entities an-old-list.json` over a
corpus that has grown used to ship the new sessions on the strength of a list
written before they existed.

A session that is still being written cannot be covered, and the row says so
with `(written N minutes ago)`. The hash is over the whole retained prose, so
every turn added to a session somebody has open changes it back and the same
refusal returns. Reading it again is not the fix. Close that session, or leave
its workspace out at the review step, then export again. The refusal prints
that paragraph only when a row really is fresh, because a sentence about a
session you have open, printed when you have none, is §F7 in prose.

What it checks is that deident put the prose in front of a reader, not that the
reader read it. That is the same limit the old gate had, one session at a time
instead of one corpus at a time.

So the file is capped, at `--batch-chars` characters (120,000 by default,
roughly 30k tokens against a stage 3 budgeted at 3.5 MB and 900k). The cap is
not about the file being awkward to open. It is that "shown" is the only thing
this gate can observe, and a 915 KB file nobody could read in one pass turned
that into a false claim: every session in it was recorded as read and the next
export printed `205/205 sessions read ok`. Only the sessions actually written
into the batch are remembered, so the rest stay uncovered and the same refusal
offers them next run. At least one session always goes in, so a single
oversized session cannot stall the loop. The file and the terminal both say how
many were deferred and that they are not recorded as read.

`deident-candidates.txt` then carries only the uncovered sessions, and says so
in its own header, because the file is what a reader is handed and a short one
has to explain why it is short:

```
# 202 more sessions are not in this file. Their content has not changed
# since you last read them, and deident remembers what you declared then.
# To read the whole corpus again:  deident export --full
```

The check row carries the count:

```
    semantic pass   the dictionary at ~/.deident-private/entities.json · 47 entities · 205/205 sessions read   ok
```

A session is also re-offered when the run's own settings change what it
retains: a tier moved, or `--include-denied` added a directory back. The prose
a reader would see is not the prose they saw last time, so it is not covered.

### 11d. `--full`

Ignores the record and puts the whole corpus in front of a reader again, for a
person who has changed their mind about what counts as an identity. Without it
the only route back is deleting a file whose path they would have to be told.

It refuses the export and writes the full `deident-candidates.txt`, then the
next run supplies the list as usual. `--full` with `--entities` is a usage
error: one says "show me everything again" and the other says "here is my
answer", so a run carrying both would read the answer and then decline to use
it.

### 11e. What reading it costs, said where the file is announced

The reader is handed `deident-candidates.txt` and, until this, had no idea what
reading it would cost. Both files that cost a reader anything now say so at the
moment they are written, and both carry it in `--json` under `tokenEstimate`.

Estimated per script, not by dividing the file by four. Measured on the real
candidates file: 459,747 characters, 131,895 of them (29%) CJK. CJK runs at
roughly one token per character and Latin at roughly one per four, so a single
divisor is wrong by a factor of four in one direction or the other depending on
the mix. The reader's own reasoning adds about 20% on top. Rounded to three
significant figures, because a figure printed to the last token invites more
trust than an estimate has earned.

Three things it does not say, and all three are the point:

- **No percentage of anyone's subscription.** deident cannot read a plan,
  cannot read remaining usage, and the limits are not published as a token
  count. Any figure there would be invented, which is worse than no figure at
  all, because a person would act on it.
- **No model-tier comparison.** `docs/model-tier.md` is where the tiers are
  weighed against each other. The tool runs one, and the reader is not choosing
  between them at this moment.
- **No second hedge.** "roughly" is the whole disclaimer.

It is **not** in the candidates file's own header, which is the one place it
looked like it belonged, since that file is what an agent reads directly. Two
reasons. The header is read once the cost is already committed, so it informs
nothing anybody can still act on. And the number would be reporting a file that
no longer exists the moment it is written into it: the line itself changes the
size it is measuring, and a self-referential estimate is one more thing to be
subtly wrong. The person deciding whether to pay is at the terminal, and the
agent orchestrating the read has it in `--json` before it opens the file.

## 12. `~/.deident-private/known-values.json`, the third source

deident had two sources of entities and both of them were inference:

```
tier 0   inferred from machine state:  username, paths, git config, credential shapes
tier 1   inferred from prose:          what a reader can see
```

There was no third: a list of literal values the person KNOWS are theirs. So the
only way a value got protected was for the tool, or a model reading the prose,
to work it out unaided.

What that cost, measured on a delivered archive whose checks were all green:
21 identity fields shipped in plaintext. Passport name orderings and three name
spellings used across visa documents, a date and place of birth, a household
registration address in two languages, three country addresses, a driving
licence address, two banks' address of record, a phone number and a
payment-platform account id. Concentrated in two sessions, one of them a
browser-automation session filling a booking form with passport data. Every one
of those values was already enumerated, by hand, in a personal-details file the
same person maintained: the tool was performing semantic discovery to find a
list that already existed.

```json
{
  "_note": "Values that are mine. Local only. Never commit this, never share it.",
  "values": [
    "1974-11-03",
    "Flat 6B, 219 Marlowe Crescent, Ashford Bay",
    {"kind": "person", "value": "Aurelio Ferreira-Nkemdirim"},
    {"kind": "account", "value": "pm-8842-31770"}
  ]
}
```

Beside the salt and `denied.json`, with the same properties: local, never
committed, never written into the archive, never into `--out`. Read at tier 0
and seeded as entities like any other.

**Shape.** A bare string is the common case, so a bare array is accepted as the
whole file, the way `denied.json` accepts one for its patterns. `kind` is
optional and changes only which pseudonym the value gets; it defaults to
`secret`, for the reason `src/entities/tier1.mjs` gives for having that kind at
all, which is that it exists so a VALUE can be named rather than only an
identity. A date of birth, a postal address and an account handle are values.
The default also keeps them out of the single-word path in
`src/entities/probe.mjs`, which proposes bare words only from a `person` and
would otherwise offer `Road`, `Crescent` and `Bay` out of every declared
address.

A declared value whose string was already seeded takes the kind it was seeded
under rather than its own. `buildEntities` keys on `(kind, canonical)`, so the
same string under two kinds is two entities sharing one spelling; `buildTable`
sorts them together, the loser matches nothing, and the probe then reports that
a declared spelling protects nothing about a value that is in fact protected.
Borrowing the kind collapses them into one entity carrying both sources, which
is also the truer record: the tool found it AND was told about it.

**Failure direction.** Missing REFUSES the export. It used to be the normal
case, and that sentence is what taught every reader to skip the file: for an
operator whose own identity is in their prose, no file means their own details
ship, and the only thing between them and that is whether a reader happens to
notice a number in a wall of text. `export` therefore asks once, and the answer
is written down. Either the file exists, or `--declare-nothing` writes it with
an empty `values` array and the date, and the manifest then states which of the
two happened: `declared: {values, acknowledgedAt}`, plus a line in the
"NOT protected against" block for the run that declared none. A run that
declared nothing and a run that declared and found no hits are different facts
and used to print the same thing. `scan`, `review` and `triage` are unaffected:
they ship nothing.

`--declare-nothing` refuses over a file that already exists rather than
overwriting it. Overwriting would drop every value the operator declared and
keep the export green, which is the failure the gate exists to stop arriving
through the door built to stop it.

Malformed REFUSES, naming the row (`known-values.json values[3]`),
the way `loadUserDeny` refuses, and for a sharper version of the same reason: an
export that silently loaded none of this list is indistinguishable, in every
check the tool has, from the export that leaked.

The load happens before anything reads a session, so a malformed file refuses in
the first second rather than at step 8 of an export that has already spent
twenty minutes in the retention pass.

**A fresh `--salt-dir` is the same trap `denied.json` has**, so it gets the same
warning: this file lives IN the salt directory, and the documented way to run as
if for the first time is a directory that does not have it. Narrow for the same
reason, too. A machine with no list anywhere is a genuine first run and is not
nagged.

**Short and ordinary values are reported, never refused.** See §6a. A person will
put a three-character string in this file, or an ordinary word, because they are
asserting that this specific string is theirs, and a source whose answer to a
deliberate declaration is "no" is a source nobody fills in.

**deident does not read anybody's personal-details file.** No path to one is
hardcoded and none is searched for. That convention is one person's, and
hardcoding it is the overfitting the per-person deny rules were moved out of the
repository to remove. The operator contract does the equivalent portably: it
tells the agent to ask whether such a file exists anywhere, and to ask the
person directly when it does not.

### 12b. Does a seventh check belong here?

The six gates are all internal-consistency checks: round trip, substitution
invariant, namespace, known-entity residue, semantic pass, on-disk rescan. Not
one compares against an external oracle, so none of them can answer "was
everything that should have been substituted, substituted". `known-values.json`
is the tool's first oracle for one class of value, which makes the question live.

**A seventh gate that re-scans the archive for the declared list would add
nothing, and adding nothing is not neutral here.** Declared values are seeded as
entities, so they are in the table `residualScan` is given, so checks 4 and 6
already sweep the produced bytes for every one of them. A second pass over the
same bytes with the same needles would read, in the report, as independent
confirmation of a result it merely repeated. That is worse than no check.

**There is exactly one gap, and it is narrow enough to name.** `buildTable`
skips an entity whose `pseudonym` is null into `flagged` and never into
`entries`, and `residualScan` sweeps `entries`. A declared value that
`rejectReason` refuses (shorter than three characters, a single CJK character, a
bare filesystem root) is therefore never substituted AND never scanned for.
Verified against the shipped modules rather than reasoned about: a declared
two-character value occurring twice in a corpus ships twice in plaintext, while
`known-entity residue: 0 occurrences of 51 entity spellings` and `archive on
disk ... ok` both pass.

That is the only place a seventh check earns its keep, and it is not the check
the question proposed. **It is built**, in `src/verify/declared.mjs`, and it is
narrow in exactly the way the gap is.

It re-reads `known-values.json` **from disk** rather than taking `mergedTable`,
which is the point rather than an implementation detail: every other check is
handed the table, and a value that never entered the table is invisible to a
check derived from it. Then it drops every needle the table already carries and
sweeps the produced bytes for what is left. Plain substring matching, both the
decoded and the JSON-escaped form, no boundary rule: the boundary rule decides
whether to REPLACE and nothing replaced these, so any occurrence at all is the
finding, and a boundary test would hide the short-value case the gap is made of.

**The needle sets are disjoint by construction**, and that is what stops this
reading as a second opinion on a result it merely repeated. The report says so
in as many words, per value rather than as a total:

```
  ! 1 of the 4 values you declared never entered the entity table, so no
    check above looked for it. The other 3 were swept by the residue scan.
    Needles re-read from known-values.json on disk, then swept over the same
    output the residue scan read. Occurrences found:
           2  secret    Qz
              …the payout account is under Qz and stays…
    A count above zero is that value, in the archive, unreplaced. Declaring a
    longer spelling that contains it is one fix; accepting it is another.
    Nothing here will refuse the export over a value you declared yourself.
```

Three things this can say that the residue scan cannot: it names values that
scan structurally does not carry, it answers per value instead of as one total,
and its needles came from the file on disk at the moment of the check rather
than from the run's own table.

**Not a gate**, and the reason has not changed: the person declared a value the
tool has already told them it cannot safely substitute, so refusing the export
would be refusing over a choice they made with the reason in front of them.

The zero case prints too. `renderGluedResidue` returns silently with no rows and
§6b records what that cost, so a list with nothing left over gets a line saying
the residue scan covered all of it. An absent block beside a green residue
figure reads as a clean result when it means not examined.

§6a's rejected rows keep their dash in the count column, because nothing
substituted those values and a `0` there is a zero where no substitution ran.
What those rows no longer say is "and not scanned for either, so this value may
still be in the archive": that stopped being true the moment this check shipped,
and §6 calls a disclosure that hides an implemented control worse than either
honest option. They point at this sweep instead.
