# Workspace privacy tiers

**Status: design for slice 2.** Slice 1 already ships the hook this plugs into
(per-directory opt-in, the deny-list, and per-line `cwd` filtering). Nothing here
changes slice 1's data path.

---

## 1. The axis is not ownership

The obvious model is "client work vs personal work". It is wrong, and it is wrong
in both directions on real data.

- `note-vault` is personal, and it is one of the better demonstrations of skill
  in the corpus. It should be exported.
- `private-archive` is personal, and it holds another person's messages. It must
  never leave the machine.

(Workspace names throughout this document are fabricated. What each one has to
carry is the shape the argument turns on: here, one personal directory that
should ship and one that must not.)

Same category, opposite treatment. The same failure runs the other way: work on
our own product is not the same exposure as work on a client's data.

Two independent questions are being conflated:

**A. Who is harmed if this leaks?** Nobody / me / a third party who never
consented / my employer.

**B. Does it demonstrate skill?** Yes, this is exactly what I want counted /
neutral / not work at all.

What a person is willing to upload is high-B and low-A. Everything else is a
different decision. Most of a real corpus is low-B, which is why the default has
to be exclude rather than include.

## 2. Four tiers, one per workspace

| Tier | What leaves | For |
|---|---|---|
| `exclude` | nothing at all | personal life, health, finances, another person's data, anything under a deny-listed path |
| `count-only` | session count, work mode, outcome, timestamps. **No text, no tool calls, no paths.** | work that should be counted but whose content is not shareable |
| `redact` | full de-identified content. The default for work. | ordinary work in our own or a client's repo |
| `open` | content with secrets stripped, entities left alone | already-public repos, open source |

### Why `count-only` exists

It is not a nicety, it is the fairness fix.

If a privacy-conservative person simply excludes half their corpus, their session
counts drop, and session count is load-bearing downstream: domain confidence
shrinks a thin record toward the prior (`PRIOR_WEIGHT = 6`), and under 8 sessions
a domain gets no level at all. **A person who protects more of their life scores
as less experienced.** That is the same shape of bug as the null-axis OVR
inflation recorded in BRIEF.md §6, and it is introduced by us rather than
inherited.

`count-only` keeps the denominators honest while exposing nothing.

## 3. Classification is proposed, not asked

Nobody is going to answer 31 questions. The tool derives a proposal from signals
it can read, and the person corrects the rows that are wrong.

| Signal | Proposed tier | |
|---|---|---|
| the workspace directory name matches the deny-list (`private`, `identity`, `payroll`, plus any token the person adds in their own file beside the salt) | `exclude` | |
| no git remote | `exclude` | |
| git remote, of any org and any visibility | `exclude` | **admissible** |
| the name reads like personal data, or is in a script the deny-list cannot read | `unclassified` | |
| no `cwd` was ever recorded, so no signal could be read | `unclassified` | |

**No proposal is exportable.** `redact` and `open` are reached only by a person
typing one of them into `review.md`, and everything the tool proposes by itself
is `exclude` or `unclassified`. This is the entry gate, and it is the whole of
it: shrink what enters the pipeline rather than harden what scans it.

The reason is measured. `scan` writes its proposal into column 1 of `review.md`,
so a proposal read back is indistinguishable from a tier somebody typed:
`scan` then `export`, with no edit in between, used to admit every
remote-bearing workspace on the machine. Two exports shipped that way with every
gate green and both leaked, and neither leak was in a work repository. A
git remote is evidence that a directory is a *repository*. It is not evidence
that its contents may be handed to anyone.

What this buys is a bound rather than a new check: whatever the substitution
still misses can only be missed inside a workspace that was named by hand. The
manifest states it (§6), and it is the first claim in that block that no
internal check produced.

**Admissible is not a tier and not an answer.** It marks the rows that carry a
git remote, so the census can count them and the refusal can list them. Without
it, default-deny is 31 questions, and privacy-tiers' own rule is that a person
facing 29 questions answers none of them. With it, the first run says which
handful of rows are worth a word.

**Unclassified fails closed**, and it is the residue rather than the default.
It differs from `exclude` in exactly one way that still matters under
default-deny: `exclude` is silent, and `unclassified` stops the export until the
person decides or passes `--skip-unclassified`. It is kept for the rows where an
instrument could not read the name at all, because silence from an instrument
that could not look is not a clearance.

Three notes on what the table can and cannot do, measured while implementing it
(2026-08-22, the operator's corpus, 43 workspaces).

**`open` is never proposed.** Repository visibility is not on disk. A remote URL
says nothing about who may read it, and BRIEF §2 forbids the network call that
would answer it. `open` is the *weaker* tier (§5), so a wrong guess leaks. This
finding generalised: `redact` is not proposed either, for the same reason one
step further out. The remote row now proposes `exclude` and says in the row how
to admit it, which also removes any need to work out whether the remote's org is
one the user belongs to. Both of those rows were the same answer anyway.

**The deny-list is read from the workspace's own directory, not from every line
that passed through it.** Applying it to any per-line `cwd` was tried and
reverted: it excluded the home directory, `ops-handover` and
`home-budget` outright, and labelled the last of those `deny-list matched:
"private"`, which is not true of that workspace: its own name carries no deny
token, which is the whole reason the label was wrong. §4 below has three levels for
exactly this reason. The wandering line is caught by level 2, twice over: by its
own deny token, and because the directory it moved into is itself an excluded
workspace.

**"Not under the projects root" was dropped from the second row.** It changed
nothing: a directory with no remote proposes `exclude` whether or not it sits
under `~/projects`, so the clause only added a machine-specific concept.

The answers are stored at `~/.deident-private/workspaces.json` and reused, so the
review happens once rather than every export. A workspace whose signals change
(a remote added, visibility flipped) is re-proposed and reverts to unclassified,
which means excluded, until confirmed.

**One migration, and one gap it does not close.** A `workspaces.json` written
before the entry gate holds tiers that may be the tool's own `redact` proposal
rather than an answer, and nothing in the record distinguishes them. Those tiers
are applied and the export warns once, naming the count and the command that
rewrites the rows; re-asking every one of them is the 29 questions above, and
overriding a recorded answer on a guess about how it was produced is the worse
error. The half that cannot be detected is a `review.md` generated by that same
version and never regenerated: its column 1 still carries the old proposal, and
`deident scan` is what rewrites it.

## 4. Workspace granularity alone is not enough

Measured on the largest real session file: 5,259 lines, **11 distinct `cwd`
values**, including `C:\Users\<you>\projects\ops-handover\private` for 1,257
of them, inside a session whose directory slug looked unremarkable. The agent
`cd`s mid-session, and the slug records only the launch directory.

So three levels of granularity are all required, and each catches what the level
above it misses:

1. **Workspace tier**, the coarse decision, made once, remembered. The
   workspace is the directory the sessions actually worked in, taken from their
   `cwd` records. It is not the storage slug: 214 of 224 real sessions were
   launched from the home directory and share one slug, so a slug-shaped
   workspace would have put 95% of the corpus behind a single decision.
2. **Per-line `cwd` filter**, catches private subdirectories reached mid-session.
   Already in slice 1.
3. **Per-session drop, after preview**, the escape hatch. The preview lists each
   session with a one-line redacted summary (its first user message, truncated),
   and anything that still looks wrong is dropped before the zip is written.

Level 3 is what makes the whole thing safe to use: no classification scheme will
be right the first time, so there has to be a last look.

**Level 3 only works if the reader can see the session.** Measured 2026-08-25
over the live corpus at depth 1: of 214 sessions, 45 (21.0%) opened with
something that told a reader nothing. 28 carried no user prompt at all and 17
opened with a bare slash command, `/clear` eleven times. Triage showed the
command envelope, the reader had nothing to judge, and the session went through.
One of the two sessions that leaked 21 identity fields was one of those.

The last look now shows the first prompt that says something, and says on the row
when that was not the first. It reads no further into any file to do it: 15 of
the 17 are answered by the very next prompt in the head that was already read.
The remaining 30 sessions that still have nothing to judge say so explicitly,
because the triage rubric already answers a row nobody can classify and its
answer is `drop`. `docs/cli-ux.md` §4b has the distribution.

### 4b. Granularity is about what is EXCLUDED. It says nothing about what is FOUND

The three levels above all answer "does this material leave". None of them
answers "was everything that should have been substituted, substituted", and a
value in a session that is kept at `redact` is protected only if some source
named it.

There were two such sources and both were inference: tier 0 from machine state,
tier 1 from prose. A finished archive whose checks were all green shipped 21
identity fields in plaintext, in sessions that were correctly tiered and
correctly kept. Nothing about the tiers was wrong. The values were simply never
named.

`~/.deident-private/known-values.json` is the third source and the only one that
is not a guess: a list of literal strings the person declares are theirs, read at
tier 0 and seeded as entities. It is orthogonal to the tiers, which is why it is
here rather than in the list above: it does not change what leaves, it changes
what is replaced in what leaves. `docs/cli-ux.md` §12 has the file shape, the
refusal behaviour and the reason no path to anybody's personal-details file is
hardcoded.

## 5. There is no strength dial, only an inclusion decision

Worth stating because it is a natural thing to assume: "client work needs
stronger de-identification" does not map onto anything the tool can do.

Redaction is already at full strength for everything in `redact`. Code content is
never exported at all, only its line count; every seeded entity is replaced; the
residual scan aborts the export on any known-entity residue. There is no stronger
setting to turn on.

The dial that exists only runs the other way: `open` is *weaker*, for work that is
already public.

So the question is never "how hard should this be scrubbed". It is "does this
leave at all, and at what granularity". Framing it as inclusion rather than
strength is what makes the tiers simple.

## 6. Differing tolerance is a comparability problem, not just a preference

Each person's `workspaces.json` is theirs, so tolerance is respected by
construction. But the corpora are then not comparable, and whoever consumes them
needs to know that.

Two things follow:

- Prefer `count-only` over `exclude` wherever the person is willing, so the
  denominators survive.
- The export manifest must state, per uploader, how many sessions fell into each
  tier. A recipient comparing two people needs to see that one of them withheld
  40% of their corpus. Hiding that turns a privacy choice into a silent skill
  gap.

## 7. Two sentences the manifest now carries, and why they are not gates

Both answer questions no check here can, because not one of them compares the
output against the sessions it came from (cli-ux §12b).

**The bound.** `every session here is from one of 14 workspaces you admitted by
name; 34 others were never admitted and contributed nothing.` This is what the
entry gate buys. It says nothing about what the substitution found, and that is
the point: it bounds where a miss can live, without claiming there are none.

**The read count.** `9 of 170 sessions were opened and read here, 161 are
unverified.` Counted from `deident review --session`, which is the only path
that puts a whole session in front of a person; a read stops counting once the
session file changes, because a transcript read in March says nothing about the
turns appended in August. `review --entity` is reported separately and never
folded in, because a drill-down shows an excerpt per occurrence and crediting a
whole session for one matched line is arithmetic, not reading. `export
--preview` counts for nothing at all: it carries one 45-character window per
entity class by construction.

Stated, never gated. A gate cleared by opening one arbitrary session buys a
checkbox rather than a look, and a gate that can only ever be red on a
205-session corpus is BRIEF §F7's first thing switched off. The number ships
with the archive to the recipient, who is the person the claim is being made to,
and it cannot be made to look better without doing the reading.
